## Overview
The challenge generally was not as difficult as the previous ones, but I still had issues centering the attribution class. Concerning HTML, a warning on my inspected browser kept on reminding me about the "content-type: text/html" and I have no idea on what to do about that
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Okay, learnt the use of the transition and transform property in css;

```css
.one, .two, .three, img {
    transition: transform .3s ease-in-out;
}

.one, .two, .three, img:hover {
    transform: translate3d(2em, 0, 2em);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still working on my centering and I will love to use the transform and transition property more in future projects. Media query is not as hard as it used to beðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤—
